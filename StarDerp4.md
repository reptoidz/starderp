>“I’m trying to re-entangle the quantum connection,” said Ensign Syrinx.  
>“Re-entangle faster ensign” said Captain Dansup.  

The U.S.S URLCloud Prime was surrounded by the Federation of FINN’s Rape Fleet. It was trying to hail the Universal United Nations for orders.  

>“I don’t think we can wait for orders. Let’s engage” said Dansup.  
>“Yes, Captain,” said Syrinx.  
>“Charge space lasers to overdrive,” said Dansup.  
>“Lasers are now in overdrive,” said Syrinx.  
>“Fire!” yelled Dansup.  

The U.S.S URLCloud Prime fired its space lasers at the Rape Fleet. It also targeted critical systems on the mothership.  

>“Fire at their RAM drive thrusters,” said Dansup.  
>“Direct hit,” said Syrinx.  
>“Fuck yeah, totes motherfuckers,” said Dansup.  

FINN’s Rape Fleet was in disarray. The mothership was hit badly and its main RAM drive thrusters were about to reverse the
code polarity.  

>“Plot a course for the fuck out of here!”  Dansup commands.  
>“Course set,” said Syrinx.  
>“Make it 5eva,” said Dansup.  

The ship entered ridiculously fast mode and traveled at warp speed 19 to the Universal United Nations main headquarters in the Kuiper belt. Just as they torpedoed through the universe, the mothership exploded sending cacti in all directions. The surrounding ships got their engines clogged by cacti and then exploded because they couldn’t vent quantum plasma.

Dansup received orders to meet up with Admiral Richard Stallman. He entered the transport room of his ship and entered a glass transport tube. The ship launched him into space and he flew towards the starbase where a giant baseball glove caught him and reeled him into the base. He made his way over to the office of Richard Stallman.  

Richard Stallman was known to be a lunatic and Dansup wasn’t the kind to mess with crazy. He did what he was told and hoped that somehow Richard Stallman would face his crimes.  

>“Come in Dansup. I heard you took out the rape fleet by yourself” said Richard Stallman.  
>"I have to thank my crew for that too,” said Dansup.  
>“Your crew is not responsible for bringing socialism and welfare to the known universe,” said Richard.  
>“You deserve credit for that Richard,” said Dansup.  

That was when Julian Assange entered the room.  

>“Quit circle jerking each other over socialism. I alone caused the destruction of the United States of America with fake leaks” said Julian Assange.  
>“Totes,” said Dansup.  

Richard Stallman walked into the kitchen and grabbed a few cans of Pepsi to hand out to his guests.  

>“Whatever happened to OpenCola?” asked Julian.  
>“It tastes like shit,” said Richard.  
>“Surprising stance… its recipe is open source” said Dansup.  
>“It’s a beverage. I’m only interested in Free Software, and socialism… Pepsi donates a lot of welfare to underprivileged planets” said Richard.  
>“Fair enough,” said Dansup.  

Julian Assange made his face scowl in anger.  

>“I am only interested in the fact that I alone destroyed the United States of America,” said Julian.  
>“2015 called and they want their news back,” said Dansup.  

Richard ate some kind of fungus off his foot and then came up with a brilliant idea.  

>“Why don’t we explode the FINN Fleet homeworld?” asked Richard.  
>“Ballsy and I like it,” said Dansup.  
>“I will begin leaking fake documents,” said Julian.  

---

In the news, people discovered a leak of documents detailing plans of the evil FINN fleet. The Universal United Nations was forced to take action because of a galactic uproar. Dansup was sent in the U.S.S URLCloud Prime with a weapon capable of destroying their entire homeworld.  

His ship arrived at the homeworld of the FINN fleet. He met no resistance at all. There were no ships prepared to defend it. There were no planetary weapons aimed at him.  

>“Hail Admiral Stallman and put him on the 720p,” said Dansup.  
>“Yes, Dansup,” said Ensign Syrinx.  

Ensign Syrinx manipulated a bunch of analog computer console controls. The image projected on their 720p plasma HD screen.  

>“What are you waiting for?” asked Richard.  
>“They are unarmed and undefended,” said Dansup.  
>“And?” asked Richard.  
>“Doesn’t that violate Geneva conventions?” asked Dansup.  
>“Geneva conventions lifted” answered Richard.  
>“I still won’t kill unarmed people. Even if it is the Federation of FINN homeworld” said Dansup.  
>“Traitor! You will be destroyed!” said Richard.  
>“I don’t see how. I’m the best Captain you have” said Dansup.  
>“Your ship’s software is free software and encryption is not installed because I made it illegal. All your passwords are in plain text!” said Richard.  
>“So… It’s still secure” said Dansup.  
>“You’re using GCC,” said Richard.  
>“For the love of God,” said Ensign Syrinx.  

The U.S.S URLCloud Prime was remotely activated by Richard Stallman. He started playing creative commons music over their intercom system to annoy them with the bad quality music.  

>“What the fuck Richard? Give me back my ship” said Dansup.  
>“I will destroy you all with my secret weapon! The DR Device!” said Richard.  
>“Wot?” said Dansup.  
>“Science Officer Inhies!” said Ensign Syrinx.  
>“It’s the M.D. Device. It’s called Doctor Device or Little Doctor for slang but stands for Molecular Disruption Device, and it is a weapon that makes it impossible for any two atoms to coexist in a molecule,” said Science Officer Inhies.  
>“Wot?” said Dansup.  
>“The fucking bastard stole the schematics from Ender’s Game when he forced Orson Scott Card at gunpoint to GPL the Enderverse,” said Science Officer Inhies.  
>“Anyways guys. Thanks for wiping out the FINN Fleet. You are GNU/Heroes” said Richard.  

Richard turned the video off and pressed a button on his console which activated the U.S.S URLCloud Prime’s DR Device. He programmed the ship's computer using haxx0r lisp to collide with the FINN Homeworld. Richard was so happy he found his pet parrot.  

>“Who is my favorite birdy?” asked Richard.  
>“I am. I am” squawked Richard’s Parrot.  

Richard and his parrot went into another room and got busy.

>“We have one chance at this mother fuckers,” said Caleb James DeLisle.  

DeLisle was Supreme Commander of the Federation of FINN which consisted of various fleets and planets. All connected together in a meshnet using the power of quantum entanglement and the Hyperboria network.  

>“I’ll get the maple syrup,” said XFaCE.  
>“I got the back bacon,” said Prurigro.  
>“Webmind can use the energy from the DR Device explosion to send us through time once,” said DeLisle.  
>“Webmind seems to be able to do anything these days,” said XFaCE.  
>“You can do a lot with encryption and a hive mind of quantum computers. That’s how we keep our information private too.  

>That’s why the Free Software Foundation hates us. They want every piece of information out in public via plain text!” said DeLisle.  

>“I know. It makes me rage sometimes” said XFaCE.  
>“Dansup’s crew is within beaming range,” said Prurigro.  
>“Alright. Beam them into the command center immediately” said DeLisle.  

Caleb James DeLisle did a dance and high fived a monkey. Richard Stallman would pay for his crimes. Dansup and his crew were beamed into the command center by Webmind and the bridge crew visited with DeLisle’s time travel task force.  

---

>“Basically we have 30 minutes until your ship armed with the DR Device crashes into the planet. Webmind is going to direct some of that energy and send two people back in time to alter the past and stop Richard Stallman” said Caleb James DeLisle.  
>“I’ll go” volunteered Captain Dansup.  
>“I’ll go too,” said Ensign Syrinx.  
>“I love it when a plan comes together. Let’s dine on a final meal of back bacon with maple syrup” shouted Caleb James DeLisle.  

Everyone drank ale and ate the back bacon with maple syrup. DeLisle was totally wasted and lit one of his farts of fire. Dansup and Syrinx were playing with Pokémon cards. Dansup used his Mind Wipe deck and owned Syrinx. The Ensign got enraged and lost control of his shapeshifting ability. His appearance was similar to a reptilian human for less than a second before solidifying back into Syrinx.  

>“That’s not Syrinx” shouted Dansup.  

Nobody heard Dansup. The ship collided with the planet and the DR Device started eating away at the planet. The Webmind A.I system was quick enough to absorb some of the energy and power of the time travel machine. It sent Ensign Syrinx and Captain Dansup through time.  

---

Dansup and Syrinx landed in the MIT AI Laboratory where Richard Stallman was studying his first year in the graduate program. They were in Richard Stallman’s backyard and he was practicing his international folk dancing.  

>“This is where Webmind said we need to slow him down,” said Syrinx.  
>“How can I trust you?” asked Dansup.  
>“Nobody wants the Free Software Foundation ruling the universe,” said Syrinx.  
>“Totes,” said Dansup.  

Syrinx shapeshifted into another person whom he called Ansuz. He made himself look like a Mormon and approached Richard.  

>“I’m from the church of latter day saints,” said Ansuz.  
>“I’m not interested in religion. I am an atheist” said Richard.  
>“That’s fine Richard. That’s some nice dancing there. Mind if I watch?” asked Ansuz.  
>“I don’t mind at all. I am a person who is pro-freedom of information” said Richard. 

Richard started his international folk dance where he pulled his pants down several times to insert hot dogs into his anus. After a while, Ansuz grew disgusted and pulled a crowbar out of his jacket. Then he smashed Richard’s knees in with it several times. Richard lay bleeding with his damaged knees while Ansuz returned to Dansup.  

>“Webmind said his joy for dancing motivated his free software efforts and that this should dampen his influence by preventing dance,” said Ansuz.  

>“I remember now. He is likely to just become an obvious lunatic as he had to do religious parodies as St Ignucious” said Dansup.  

Ansuz smashed Dansup over the face with a bottle and froze him in ice.

Dansup woke up in 1996 in the basement next to a dead little girl and a ransom note. He heard shouting all around him as police rushed into the room. On the news later that day the world found out JonBenét the child beauty queen was found murdered. There had been a failed attempted at kidnapping when the culprit overdosed on drugs before he had a chance to escape with the body. He was arrested and sentenced to life in prison.  

Ansuz used DNA from the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaton to create a new life form he called Barrack Obama. From this platform, he lied about being socialist and enabled capitalists to rule the universe in a truly free and open market with no interference from any government.  

Life was good until communism was rediscovered in 7125 and another group of time travelers would solve that problem as well.
